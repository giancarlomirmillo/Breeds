A workaround for the dialogflow knowledgebase language restriction.

To use this example from the dialogflow console inlilne editor, copy the code and paste it in the inline editor and replace the service key and service email with your own service key and service email.

Using the dialogflow Nodejs clients, place the key and service email value in a .env file and reference it appropriately.
